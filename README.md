**Important: I could not get the app to run simply by pressing the green button in NetBeans, so you'll need to click on the project in the left panel, go to the Navigation panel and double-click "javafx run". Alternatively, open command line, go to the CalQ folder and run "mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=calq.calq.App". Unfortunately, I still couldn't / didn't have the time to get the tests run properly.**

In case you're someone following me or just found this through my profile, this **is** for a university course, but I do hope to make this into something I'd actually use outside of that as well.
